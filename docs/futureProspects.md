# Future Prospects

## Onboarding eSIM providers on-chain

Currently, Koki'o operates as an intermediary, partnering with eSIM providers to facilitate transactions. When users purchase eSIMs or data bundles, Koki'o collects the payments and transfers them to the respective eSIM provider.

In the future, Koki'o aims to onboard eSIM providers directly on-chain, eliminating the need for a middleman. This will enable users to make payments directly to the eSIM providers, enhancing transparency and reducing friction in the transaction process. Koki'o will continue to maintain the mobile app and the servers that integrate with the eSIM provider partner APIs, ensuring a seamless user experience.
