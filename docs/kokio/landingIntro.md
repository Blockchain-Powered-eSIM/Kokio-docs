# Kokio

Fostering **True Ownership, Privacy and Security** in global connectivity.

Koki'o allows users to purchase eSIMs and data bundles using both **crypto and FIAT**.
With coverage in 200+ countries, including specialized regional and global plans, Koki'o provides users with the freedom to stay connected wherever they go.

The application is entirely **Passwordless and keyless**, allowing users to authenticate and complete payments using their biometrics.
The application generates smart contract based **account abstracted wallets** at the time of purchase, ensuring ownership of eSIM and purchased plans.
All the purchases are recorded on-chain, ensuring **transparency and trust**.

Koki'o bridges the gap between traditional finance and blockchain. Users who initially purchase with FIAT can _seamlessly transition to crypto at any time_. When they create a smart wallet, all previous purchase transactions are automatically reflected in the wallet, making it easy to track and manage their connectivity history.

Smart contracts not only ensure user ownership but also **introduce verifiability** and _enhance interoperability for telecom operators_. This makes it easier for telecom providers to integrate and offer consistent service, further strengthening the global connectivity ecosystem.
