# Introduction

An [eSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM) (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM embedded directly into devices like phones or smartwatches, enabling remote connectivity to mobile networks and simplifying the process for wearables and innovative devices.

### Benefits of eSIMs

- **Security**: Offers equivalent security to removable SIMs, ensuring secure network access, privacy, and billing integrity, especially in roaming.
- **End Users**: Simplifies subscription management, eliminating the need for multiple physical SIM cards.
- **Distributors**: Reduces logistics complexity and customization needs for specific operators or regions.
- **Operators**: Expands business opportunities in emerging markets (e.g., automotive, wearables) and reduces SIM distribution costs, enabling new subscription models.
- **Device Manufacturers**: Allows smaller, more durable devices by reducing space requirements and improving resistance to environmental factors. eSIMs also optimize supply chain processes.
