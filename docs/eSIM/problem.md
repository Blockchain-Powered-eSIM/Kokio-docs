# The Problem with eSIMs

eSIMs (embedded SIMs) offer convenience by enabling remote connectivity for devices like smartwatches and IoT gadgets, eliminating the need for physical SIM cards. However, the shift to digital SIMs raises significant **security and privacy concerns** and challenges such as vulnerabilities in provisioning, lack of standardization, social engineering, dependence on integrity of manufacturers and operators for eSIM security. While eSIMs advance mobile connectivity, addressing their challenges require **stronger standardization**, **improved user education**, and **robust security practices** from carriers and manufacturers to ensure a secure and user-friendly experience.

Even with ongoing improvements, the **security of consumer eSIM data** has not kept pace with evolving threats, leaving users vulnerable to privacy invasion, fraud and unauthorised access of sensitive information.
